There are many variations to a walk through the Burbage Woods. These are among the more attractive rambles in our immediate neighbourhood. They are usually taken for a leisurely Sunday afternoon's stroll, but they can be extended by less frequented and little known footpaths to Sapcote, Stoney Stanton, Elmesthorpe and Croft. All of these well repay an exploration.

Any walks in this direction should include the Burbage Common. This is best approached from Butt Lane and Beacon Hill.

If we could only forget the coming winter, a walk during the bright days of autumn is as full of pleasure and charm as any season of the year. After the first cold snaps and before the leaves begin to fall, we have days of ever-mellowing colour. The trees and hedgerows seem to expire in a glowing fire of reds and yellows—a gamut of tone from the dark russets of the beech to the bright ochres of the maple. One of the most entrancing sights to be seen in this neighbourhood during this year was the undergrowth of bracken during October and November in the oak woods of Bentley and Merevale. There is little bracken around Hinckley, but the trees and hedgerows are full of colour. The wealth of May-blossom and dog rose of the spring and summer has produced patches of flaming haws and hips.

From Beacon Hill a view of a good portion of South Leicestershire can be obtained. Nichols states that 50 churches can be counted. Croft Hill appears like a mole-hill on the plain, and beyond, the similar conical-shaped mass of Billesdon Coplow breaks the sky-line. To the right, the horizon is bounded by the hills of Northamptonshire around North Kilworth and Naseby.

In the first field beyond Forest View botanists will be able to find an interesting little spring flower. In the hedge bottom to the left of the footpath grows the moschatel, easily distinguished by its small bright green delicate leaves and head of greeny-white flowers.

On reaching the stile at the Common, a mound will be seen extending on either side, following the brook and hedgerow. The hedge on the left is the parish boundary between Hinckley and Burbage.

The late Mr. Thos. Harrold suggested that this mound was a "Deer's Leap" surrounding the ancient park of the Barons of Hinckley. A deer's leap was so constructed that a deer could leap into the enclosure but could not leap back again.

A field away to the left is the site of "Cogg's Well," an iron-impregnated spring that probably still retains valuable medicinal properties.

Burbage Common is a bit of ancient moorland that perhaps only golfers enjoy to the full. What it lacks as an ideal course is made up for by its breezy open space. It forms part of the Manor of Burbage over which only the copyholders have certain rights of joistage, but the public have for years enjoyed it as a natural park to wander where they please. Its moorland features have now almost disappeared—just a few stunted patches of ling (or heather as it is more popularly known) alone remain and a few bog plants that have survived the drainage. Years ago when the gorse was allowed to grow almost unrestrained, the Common in the springtime was a mass of blazing gold.

There are still many Grammar School Old Boys who will remember threading their way through its devious pathways o'er-topped by six foot bushes, either drilled by some "Canadian officer" or adorned with bloodthirsty weapons, feather head dress, scalps, mocassins and war paint, peering through the prickly undergrowth.

Among the small moorland plants remaining are the milk-wort, louse-wort (_pedicularis_)—its former use is indicated by its name—the sneeze-wort and heath bedstraw.

Crossing the Common by following the north side of Sheepy Wood, we pass under the railway bridge and reach Smithy Lane, leaving the Wood Cottage away to the right. This has always been a popular rendezvous. For many years it was tenanted by Mr. Charles Webb, woodman to Lady Lucas, before the estate was cut up and the woodlands divided.

Proceeding along Smithy Lane, we follow the Burbage Woods on our right until we come to a gate on the left leading through the Aston Firs. As a result of a gratuitous offer of 21 acres of the Burbage Woods, and through the good offices of the Hinckley Rotary Club, efforts are being made at the present time to preserve Burbage Woods from demolition. All those interested in the preservation of the country-side will wish their efforts well. The woods are particularly rich in flora. Many rare plants such as the Butterfly Orchis and Herb Paris are to be found there, and a colony of _Rosa arvensis_ that a distinguished botanist has described as one of the finest in the country. The timber is chiefly ash and oakwood. The woods adjoining the Aston Firs have been partially cleared. Some well grown Scotch firs once bordered the pathway, a favourite nesting place of the wood pigeon. The native red squirrel was also once a pretty and common sight in these woods. It is now seldom, if ever, seen.

Two fields beyond the Aston Firs we reach a path running at right angles towards Barwell, but we cross a stile on our right and follow a hedgeside path leading to the Sapcote Freeholt Wood. This has also an interesting flora including _Orchis mascula_ and the Guelder Rose. In the spring the easterly side is covered with the glorious blue haze of the wild hyacinth. In the summer, hidden beneath a bower of hazel and crab trees, the Boy Scouts and Toc H. here find a congenial camping ground.

The path through the Sapcote Wood is easily followed. After leaving the wood it crosses two fields diagonally and emerges on the Sapcote Road. The walk can then be extended towards Elmesthorpe by following the main road in the direction of Sapcote for a few yards until we come to the first gate on the left hand side. This is the Bridle Road to Elmesthorpe. We pass two small farms on our left, the second is known as Hobbs Hayes. The Sapcote Wood is perhaps better known by Hobbs Hayes, and it is very likely that this is its correct name. Hayes or Hays is an old English name for a belt of woodland. The Sapcote Parish boundary follows the wood along its western side.

In a field adjoining the bridle road near Hobbs Hayes farm, an attempt was made to reach the coal beds supposedly underlying the woods. It is astonishing how the idea that coal is to be found here still persists. One can only surmise that it arises from the knowledge that our coal fields are the remains of decayed forest lands. There can be no reason for thinking, however, that there is any connection between our woodlands and the primeval forests of Carboniferous times. England has been beneath the sea several times since then. Millions of years and in some cases thousands of feet of solid rock divide them. The Hobbs Hayes boring was commenced about 1860. The engineers had to bore through 470 feet of marl and sandstone before reaching the coal measures. All that they found was a thin seam of bat or clunch. They gave it up as a bad job after penetrating some 974 ft. of underlying Cambrian rocks under which no coal is ever found. Geologists of late are inclined to believe that no part of the carboniferous measures were found in the boring.

Just past Hobbs Hayes where the Bridle road (now only a footpath) to Elmesthorpe bears right, a stile will be seen on the left leading to a footpath in the direction of Woodhouse Farm—once known as Huddlestone's. We follow this past a pond and some farm buildings on to another Bridle road leading to Elmesthorpe Station.

Before leaving the farm it might be interesting to recall one of its former tenants—Richard Fowke, farmer and antiquarian, friend of Nichols and Throsby. Between his agricultural pursuits and the regaling with old-time hospitality of many callers, he found time to create a museum and write a diary.

Here are two extracts dated 1811:—

> Feb. 21.—Shrove Tuesday or Pancake Day. Some people have been robbed near Hinckley lately. The gallows grows for them to season again Swingham Fair (i.e., the assizes).
>
> April 8.—Riots by the stocking makers of Hinckley about the prices. On Saturday night breaking windows, plundering and burning and pulling down houses.

We are now on the Elmesthorpe Bridle road. Do not follow this but cross the road and make for the corner of the field opposite to you in the direction of the railway line, keeping a little house on your left. The footpath will then appear more clearly defined leading along the hedgerow to a "ladder stile" and level crossing over the railway. The path then brings you in a few yards to Billington Roughs. There have been many conjectures as to the origin of these fields, surrounded by a high bank and dotted with conical hummocks. On the ordnance maps they are marked "old fish ponds" and it is conjectured that they were part of the ornamental park laid out by Sir William Cockayne (later Lord Cullen) when resident at Elmesthorpe. I am inclined to think they are much older. There is a local legend—as far as I can ascertain without any foundation of truth—that Cromwell planted his cannon here to demolish Elmesthorpe Church. Throsby records another legend that Lord Cullen hid his treasures in a hollow on one of the islands during the Civil War.

A footpath leads across two fields to Elmesthorpe's partly ruined Church. Dating from the early 14th century it contains an ancient massive stone mortar found near Red Hall.

This has Roman characteristics, but Mr. Reginald Smith of the British Museum suggests it might be a mediæval kitchen utensil. He was amused to learn it was now doing duty as a baptismal font.

Aubrey de Vere, Earl of Oxford, at one time owned the Manor of Elmesthorpe. There are some who attribute the works of Shakespeare to this Elizabethan nobleman.

A huge stone coffin was found near the Church in the middle of last century. It is now in Leicester Museum. I have been told it was carted there by night. Half-way, a jolt threw it out of the cart and broke it in two. A Hinckley man who was assisting was so scared that he left his companion and fled.

To return from Billington Roughs we cross a field by following the brook upstream to a Bridle road from Elmesthorpe Church. We there turn left and follow the road and a footpath past a farm to Ingles' Bridge. Then by the Bridle road across the Common and home.

An alternative route can be taken by crossing the first Bridle road and following a path almost immediately opposite. Keeping the brook on the left we cross two small meadows and then diagonally across a larger field to a stile. The path then follows the hedgerow and brings us out on the Leicester Road near the Barwell turn. Two fields from the road we pass by the corner of a large rectangular earthwork, the origin of which is at present obscure.
