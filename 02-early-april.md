One of the most pleasant walks in the district at whatever time of the year, must surely be that from Stapleton to Kirkby Mallory. In a month's time when the trees are putting on their new spring coats and the fields and hedgerows bedecking themselves with jewels, you will find no more delightful country walk in the Midlands.

Take a luncheon ration and start off early some bright sunny morning. The walk, of course, can be reversed, but if the outward journey is made by Stapleton the prospect will be enhanced by having the sun behind you. A 'bus to the Barwell House corner will be of help and it is possible that a lift may be had to the village of Stapleton where our ramble commences.

A glance around the village is worth while. The Church has a miniature tower and steeple of stone. Throsby writing in 1790 states, "The Chapel has one aisle with a low spire. The Chancel is a dirty place indeed; it would rather excite indignation than worship." This may have reached the ears of the bishop, for in 1808 the Church was entirely renovated.

In my early days the Tower was clad in a thick mantle of ivy. A school chum and I used to find some excellent sport there by working a sparrow net from the battlements. One night we caught a white sparrow—a pure albino. In the 18th century a Dr. Dawes, as he was called, lived in the village of Stapleton. He was said to be a farmer of good property but coveted to be a philosopher. Instead of ploughing, sowing, reaping and mowing, he spent most of his time in sinking wells to find treasure, blowing charcoal and seeking the philosopher's stone, and so his estate dwindled away piece-meal. He died in debt almost in a state of beggary. "At his death the cornstacks on his farm were fired to destroy the amazing stock of vermin they contained which fed sweetly on his neglected stores." The only contribution Dawes made to posterity was to prove the virtue of that old Latin saw "Let the cobbler stick to his last."

After passing through the village, we take to the fields by a stile easily to be found on the right hand side where the recently widened road swings round in the direction of Cadeby. To avoid mistakes it is always advisable to consult a native. Once found, the path is quite distinct for almost the whole of the distance to Kirkby.

Crossing the first field we bear left and then swing sharp left passing a small pond and following a well defined path along the hedgerow until we come to the Bridle road from Stapleton to Earl Shilton. We leave Barwell fields farm just across the parish boundary on our right. It probably takes its name from the common fields, cultivated by the tenants of Barwell Manor under a system that prevailed from Feudal times until the end of the eighteenth century. Before the Enclosure Acts about 1780, all farm-houses were situated in the town or village. The ploughlands were cultivated in strips. Over the pasture lands the tenants had grazing rights in common, and when the communal Swindeherd blew his horn in the village on an autumn morn every copyholder let out his pig to feed on the beech mast and acorns of the woodlands.

The sun is shining and the birds are now in full song. Crows are mating in the ploughed fields and rooks are busy gathering nest-building material for their colonies in the trees. A flock of finches dart in and out of the hedgerows and a lonely warbler pipes away on the topmost branch of an ash sapling. It's good to be alive. By the way, the gay little chaffinch seems to be getting as numerous in the country as the sparrow is in the towns. During the walk several brace of partridges got up quite close to us and skimmed over the fields with a whirr. It is difficult to recognise the hedgerow trees without their foliage, but the holly is much in evidence. The quantity of holly to be seen around Stapleton and Cadeby must be due to favourable conditions in the soil.

But we have arrived at the Bridle road. With the exception of one point where a stile has been substituted for a gate, one could still drive a vehicle along this road through lanes and fields to Earl Shilton. Crossing the lane, a stile will be seen almost immediately opposite. A glacial boulder does duty as a stepping stone. The path crosses the field diagonally, leaving a small farm house on the left hand side. Across the next field of old springing turfland, we make for the right hand bottom corner. As we descend the slope we have a delightful view across the valley. Away to the right, the grey tower of Kirkby Church and the white facade of Kirkby Hall stand out on the sky line, girt with the contrasting foliage of coniferous trees. Immediately in front, the Kirkby woods stretch out in a mass of grey and purply shadows which define themselves as we approach into the boles and nude branches of ash and oak tree. At the foot of the valley we cross a swiftly flowing stream by a footbridge. This is a little tributary of the Soar. It rises near Newbold Verdon, flows by Brascote House and is crossed by the Leicester main road at the foot of Shilton Hill.

The spot where we cross is marked by a small spinney of willows and alder with an undergrowth of blackthorn and sallow. The male catkins of the hazel have already appeared—its little female flowerets of a bright red hue will soon follow. The sallow is also showing signs of bursting into the golden oval panicles so familiar to the youngsters as palm.

We cross a low lying meadow and as we approach the wood, the harsh raucous cry of a jay bird is heard above the song of the birds. The cry of the green woodpecker is not much more musical, but he is not such a mischievous fellow as this gaily plumaged marauder.

The south side of the woods is bounded by an artificial bank and vallum, apparently to contain a brook that once found its way to the valley by a sluice or waterfall at the point where we reach the wood. Other earthworks in the neighbourhood are more difficult to account for. After passing through a wicket gate and across a small meadow on the fringe of the woods, we cross another rivulet as we reach Kirkby Park. Here must be the haunt of the kingfisher. A quiet rest would surely reward the wayfarer with a glimpse of this gorgeously coloured bird. Throsby quotes:

> "Hither the peaceful Halcyon flies<br>
> From social meads and open skies,<br>
> Pleased by this rill her course to steer,<br>
> And hide her sapphire plumage here."

A long climb upwards through the park brings us to the village by a gate midway between the Hall and Church. In his "Leicestershire Excursions," Throsby describes the view from this point in very enthusiastic terms. Looking back towards Stapleton, we get a delightful view of old park land stretching across the valley and up the distant hill, dotted here and there with giant oaks—survivors of the primeval forest—and a herd of black cattle that have replaced the red deer to be seen in Throsby's time. Little else is changed.

The Hall, once the residence of Viscount Wentworth, is of plain Georgian character quite devoid of decoration, but spacious and inviting in large open grounds. Both the Hall and the Church are full of associations with the families of Noel and Lovelace. An association that extended to Earl Shilton and beyond and left a considerable influence for good on the whole neighbourhood. Kirkby is now probably more famous on account of its connection with the poet Byron.

Anne Isabella Millbank, the grand-daughter of Sir Edward Noel, Baron Wentworth, married the poet in 1815 and in early life was a frequent visitor to Kirkby Hall. I have heard an old aunt of mine relate how she once met Lady Byron when visiting there. This aunt lived to a great age. She was a granddaughter of the estate carpenter named Bonsir. When a little girl, Lady Byron came to the cottage after an absence of nearly 20 years and asked to see her grandfather, telling her mother not to say who it was. Her grandfather came in wearing the felt top hat usual in those days. Doffing his hat and bowing, he said "Good afternoon, your Ladyship," and her Ladyship was very delighted that Bonsir had recognised her.

A good deal of controversy has raged over the character of Lady Byron. Earl Lovelace, her son-in-law, described her as cold and severe. My aunt supported the opinion of Mr. Child, who has taken a prominent part in Byron controversy, that she was both pretty and vivacious.

Kirkby Church is the mother church of Earl Shilton. Many will remember the Hon. the Rev. Augustus Byron, who was Rector there for many years. He kept a large stable and regularly hunted with hounds. The village has not been the same since he died, say the old inhabitants. But its the same story one can hear all over the countryside. The days of the old ancestral squire, however maligned he was, many a cottage and farm tenant would like to see again.

The origin of the name of Kirkby is fairly obvious; the suffix "by" is common to many Danish place names and implies a small hamlet. The latter part of the name is derived from the family of Malory's, who were resident here in Norman times. One, Ankitell, was the Governor of the town and castle of Leicester, a later member of the family was Sir Thomas Malory, the author of _"Morte d'Arthur."_

Where stood their Norman Castle or dwelling? Was it within the large double-moated rectangular enclosure now known as Kirkby Motts? If not, what could these earthworks, entailing such a tremendous amount of labour in their construction, have been? At present they are a riddle which the wisest cannot answer with certainty. If you have the time to spare and the necessary permission, the Motts are well worth exploring. They will be found on the right hand side of the road leading to Newbold Verdon. An old grey fox got up when I was last there.

There is a little cottage near the Rectory, where one can get a refreshing cup of tea. After which we can either return home by Brockey Lane to Barwell, or the ramble can be continued to Earl Shilton. I chose the latter. It is almost as near to the Leicester 'bus route. The sign post to Barwell will be seen in the village. Follow this road to the bottom of the hill. After passing over the brook a small house will be seen on the left hand side. The Bridle road from Stapleton to Earl Shilton crosses here, so we take the gate to the left and follow it almost to the foot of Shilton Hill. At the commencement the road is water-logged, but this can be avoided so long as a straight direction is kept. In the third field is a small moated enclosure, partially surrounded by water, charted on the ordnance survey map but not described. The hummocky nature of the field adjoining suggests an early occupation site; but excavations could alone reveal its nature and age. In a field on the Barwell side of this moat the meadow saffron (_Colchicum autumnale_) was growing up to quite recently and possibly a search would find it there still. The flower is like a pale reddish-purple crocus and has become so rare that its locale is of great interest to botanists throughout the County. As its name implies, it flowers in the autumn. Its seeds and bulbs are a remedy for the gout. Its rareness has been attributed to the fact that it is poisonous to cattle, but I have seen it growing in profusion and quite unrestrained on the pasture lands of the Swiss Alps.
