## Foreword

Wherever the young man’s fancy may turn with this welcome return to warmth and sunshine, the healthy and vigorous will surely turn to the open country. The wide and open spaces—windowless, doorless and roofless—where one can inflate the lungs and expand the vision. Many will take to the roads in cars; some on “shank’s pony”; a diminishing few will leave the roads altogether and take to the fields and by-lanes.

Local Authorities are undoubtedly doing good work in providing footpaths along the main roads to lessen the dangers of rapidly-increasing motor traffic, but the pleasure of walking along a main road, owing to its dust and noise, is gone for ever. Years ago, an occasional stage coach—picturesque and romantic—a jogging farmer’s cart or hay wagon, might have added to the delights of the highway. Modern traffic is a different thing. It is quite devoid of all charm and restfulness so necessary to the enjoyment of any walk. The fields, the meadows and the cornfield paths are still left to us. If we do not use them they may slip from our grasp. In the hope of reviving an interest in our local country walks, perchance also in the objects of historical interest that lie in their path, these short notes are written.
