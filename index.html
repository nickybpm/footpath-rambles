<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>Wherever the young man’s fancy may turn with this welcome return to warmth and sunshine, the healthy and vigorous will surely turn to the open country. The wide and open spaces—windowless, doorless and roofless—where one can inflate the lungs and expand the vision. Many will take to the roads in cars; some on “shank’s pony”; a diminishing few will leave the roads altogether and take to the fields and by-lanes.</p>

<p>Local Authorities are undoubtedly doing good work in providing footpaths along the main roads to lessen the dangers of rapidly-increasing motor traffic, but the pleasure of walking along a main road, owing to its dust and noise, is gone for ever. Years ago, an occasional stage coach—picturesque and romantic—a jogging farmer’s cart or hay wagon, might have added to the delights of the highway. Modern traffic is a different thing. It is quite devoid of all charm and restfulness so necessary to the enjoyment of any walk. The fields, the meadows and the cornfield paths are still left to us. If we do not use them they may slip from our grasp. In the hope of reviving an interest in our local country walks, perchance also in the objects of historical interest that lie in their path, these short notes are written.</p>

<p>To go to sleep during a cheerless winter and then suddenly to wake up with the
warmth of spring sunshine, is a pleasure denied to all but hibernating animals.
But the greatest joy of life must surely be the experience of the first few days
of spring after enduring the trials of a more than usually trying winter.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning last the writer rose with the birds. A blue cloudless sky and
scarcely a breeze to temper the sun's genial warmth. A brave good morning. None
could be better to search out with the help of an ordnance map some of the
disappearing footpaths that once linked up hamlet and town all over the country
side.</p>

<p>There are several ways of reaching the little village of Sutton from Hinckley
without using the main roads. The nearest would be to go by Middlefield Lane
past Cold Comfort Farm to Rogues Lane, then take to the fields by a footpath
that commences at the next hedgerow across the lane in the direction of Stoke
Golding. On Sunday morning I chose to take a 'bus to the corner of Barwell Lane
and take to the fields just before reaching Abraham's Bridge at the lowest part
of the Stapleton Road. The stile is easily found on the left hand side some 20
yards before reaching the foot of the hill. The path is well worn, and even as I
reached it one or two men with dogs got over the stile, crossed the road, and
made their way in the direction of Barwell by a path on the other side. We have
doubtless to thank this gentleman with a dog for so far preserving our footpaths
for posterity. He is not always a poacher, more often he is a keen lover of
nature with the wanderlust of his ancestors, enjoying the country ramble almost
as much as he knows that his dog does. Two old stockingers whom I know are
typical of their class. Although they are not primed with survey maps they
probably know every footpath around Hinckley within a radius of five or six
miles, and any fine day when work is slack you may meet them miles off the
beaten track enjoying the delights of the fields and hedgerows. Here's luck to
them at their journey's end. By the way, they suggested these little guides to
me some years ago. They need little guiding, but they may interest them.</p>

<p>To commence our walk. The path lies across low lying meadow land—the grass is
dry and colourless. "February fill-dike" this year has quite belied its
name—little rain has fallen for weeks. After a spell of sunshine and dry
easterly winds, hardly a blade of green grass is to be seen. Occasional patches
of blackened soil mark where a fire has spread over the fields, converting the
coarse tufts into a useful dressing, an unsightly scar soon to disappear in a
fresh mantle of green. On the right and parallel with our path runs the River
Tweed which takes its rise near Frog Island, Barwell. It is here quite a merry,
swift running stream. Up to now it has kept to almost straight courses, but here
it meanders in and out in a most inconsequential manner.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note how the features of a streamlet are an exact miniature
of a mighty river. Here a series of horse-shoe bends are a tiny replica of the
Wye at Symonds Yat. On the inside of the bend, the bank drops sheer down to the
water's edge like a miniature cliff; and on the outside of the sweep, the bank
slopes down in a gentle gradient or in shallow terraces with a beach of sand or
gravel.</p>

<p>At the third field from the road we cross a little tributary by a railway
sleeper bridge. A group of red and pollarded willows again attract one to the
banks of the stream. A snipe gets up, and uttering a sharp note of alarm, makes
off with its peculiar low scudding flight across the fields. Sticklebacks dart
to and fro' in the stream. (Further on its course, in the direction of Shenton,
the stream is well stocked with grayling.) Caddis worms in their pebble suit of
armour crawl over the stream bed, and in the shallows, water plants are
beginning to climb to the surface and the sun. Among the more vigorous is the
water cress and one of a big family of veronicas, the little water blue eye with
the big name of <em>beccabunga</em>.</p>

<p>In the sixth field from the road the path runs along the south side of a
hedgerow. Although the snow-drifts have not entirely gone from the shade, the
banks here are warming under the sunshine and all the big family of hedgerow
plants are bursting into life again. Clusters of little annual seedlings are
peeping through. Herbaceous plants are unfolding their radical leaves. <em>Crepis</em>
and thistle dot the banks with bright green and variegated rosettes. We pass
over a field of a semi-bogland nature. Before the fields were systematically
drained, there was a great deal of similar land. <em>Juncus</em> and sedge betray the
sodden condition of the subsoil.</p>

<p>On the higher land towards Stapleton is the supposed site of the encampment of
Richard III on the eve of the battle of Bosworth Field. Through this valley,
watered by the Tweed, his ill fated troops moved towards Redmore.</p>

<p>At the ninth field a clump of willows and alder mark the place where the Tweed
is joined by a stream that takes its rise in Barwell Lane, Hinckley. Here we
turn sharp right, cross two fields of turf land to Harper's Hill on the Tweed,
ascend to Dadlington road. On reaching this bridle road a stile will be seen
immediately opposite. The path here is very indistinct. Sheep tracks are more
conspicuous, but follow the Electric Power Company's wires across four open
fields to the bottom of the valley. As we descend the slope, to the left we
survey the field of Bosworth. The Sutton fields to the left we survey the field
of Bosworth. The Sutton fields to the left we survey the field of Bosworth which
the battle surged away to the left we survey the field of Bosworth which the
battle surged Ambien woods mark the spot around which the battle surged away to
the left we survey the field of Bosworth which the battle surged Ambien woods
mark the spot around which the stone pyramid over the well where King Dick is
said to have drank "while hotly pressed for life and crown."</p>

<p>At the bottom of the valley we cross the Sence Brook. This joins the Tweed near
the Ashby Canal. They in turn flow into the Anker, the Anker into the Tame, the
Tame into the Trent, the Trent into the Humber and so to the sea. One wonders
how long the waters of this little brook would take to reach the ocean.</p>

<p>In crossing the field before the brook is reached bear to the left. A single
plank now does duty for a bridge. After crossing the brook the path cuts off the
corner of a long narrow field stretching away from you. Jump a narrow brook on
the left and proceed in a north westerly direction across a J-shaped meadow to a
stile which will be seen to your left half-way up the field. It is necessary
here to cross a ploughed field, but you won't mind this if you are equipped for
the journey. Two more fields of grass land, keeping a plantation of spruce or
fir on the right, brings you to a narrow lane leading into the village of Sutton
Cheney. In the last field are hydrant posts indicating the line of the
Snarestone water main to Hinckley.</p>

<p>Some hundred yards or more on the east side of the lane we have now entered, is
a small square field known as Dicken's Nook. It was here that King Richard was
said to have harangued his troops on the eve of the battle. A much more likely
spot for such a purpose is the field nearer the village which Mr. Thompson, of
Sutton Hall, tells me is described as Dicken's Close. In this field is a deep
hollow intersected by a spring, and on the westerly slopes very extensive
earthworks. But it is not at all likely that these earthworks were thrown up by
King Richard's army.</p>

<p>The mounds are approached by two vallums or hollow ways quite distinct from a
moat. The presence of a spring and numerous pot boilers strewn round the site,
suggest an early occupation site, and its close proximity to a Bronze Age
Tumulus or burial place gives us a probable date. The tumulus can be seen on the
Bosworth side of the village just past the church. It was partially excavated by
Sir John Evans when residing at Bosworth.</p>

<p>Dickens is another name for devil, and I should infer that Dickens' Nook was
believed to be haunted by his satanic majesty long before the battle of
Bosworth.</p>

<p>Sutton Cheney derives the latter part of its name from a rich farmer named
Chainell who, Nicholls tells us, held lands here as tenant of the Abbey of
Croyland. The church is not an inspiring edifice although not without interest.
Within is an alabaster tomb of a knight in armour. The inscription reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Heere lyeth interred the body of Sir William Roberts, knight, who in his life
time being devoted to hospitality and charity among other remarkable works
erected out of a pious mind an hospitale for sixe poor men adjoyneing to this
Church-yard, and endowed it with 20 pound land yearly for their maintenance for
ever."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thomas Simpson, the prodigy of Market Bosworth, lies buried in the churchyard
"after rending asunder the fetters of indigence" he became an eminent
mathematician and a Fellow of the Royal Society. In his young days he took to
fortune telling and frightened a poor Nuneaton widow out of her wits.</p>

<p>Before leaving the village a glance at the old Hall would be worth while. It is
a fine old bit of Jacobean work built of red brick with stone mullions and
facings. A stone panel with date and initials on the front informs us that it
was built by William Roberts and his wife in 1613.</p>

<p>From Sutton Cheney the energetic can walk into Bosworth along the fringe of the
park, returning by 'bus or train.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to return over the fields to Stapleton by a footpath
that follows the route of an old bridle road, a continuation in almost a
straight line of the lane by which we came into the village of Sutton. This
brings us out at the Manor Farm, Stapleton.</p>

<p>By this path we pass away on the right an old farm house called Hangman's Hall.
The origin of the name I have been unable to trace.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Thomas Harrold, whose memories of Hinckley and District went back
to the first half of the last century, could not suggest an explanation, but he
stated that it was supposed to be haunted.</p>

<p>A number of men went over from Hinckley one night to lay the ghost. A wag wrote
some doggerel verses in the vernacular describing their adventures, one stanza
ran:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"A sudden crash made us all start<br>
And struck our earholes to the heart,"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a choice literary effort, but typical of a good deal written in those days.</p>

<h1>To Higham-on-the-Hill (May)</h1>

<p><figure>

</figure></p>

<p>A well worn path from the Hollycroft to Higham-on-the-Hill proves that this walk is still appreciated by many. Before the public baths were built it was used as a short cut to the canal, and many a pleasant pilgrimage has the writer made along this path after school hours.</p>

<p>A little spinney of poplars once grew at the commencement of Sandy Walk where our ramble commences. A formidable fence of six strands of barbed wire, reminiscent of a prisoner's compound, now encloses what was then an open field path. But the unpleasant reminder only continues the length of one field, and soon we are in the clear, open country. On the left the sandy ploughlands dip down to the valley where rises the Battling Brook. In the days of our primitive ancestors a small lake fringed with rush and boglands filled the valley.</p>

<p>The path cannot be mistaken; it follows a comparatively straight course almost to Higham. As we walk, the water tower at Bedworth and the chimneys of Exhall and Keresley collieries can be seen on the skyline to our left. On a clear day anyone with a keen eyesight can make out the spires of Coventry. As we o'ertop the rise, the horizon is still further extended to the Hartshill Range with Tuttle Hill windmill, Ansley Hall colliery and the woods of Hartshill Hays and Oldbury standing out clear. We keep to the hedgerow through a field of growing corn, leaving Wykin Hall, surrounded by a clump of trees, to our right. Wykin once had a little church served by the monks from Hinckley. The Hall, a picturesque gabled house dating probably from the Fifteenth Century, was moated. Canning, the statesman, expressed a wish to live there on his retirement. It was the home of the Wightman family. One of this family was a benefactor to the town.</p>

<p>Another who was burned at the stake at Lichfield during the religious persecutions of the early Seventeenth Century, was said to be the last martyr.</p>

<p>In the cornfields hereabouts wild flowers are plentiful. The corn poppy, speedwell, fumitory, and stork's bill are already in evidence, but only the little "blue eye" is in flower. We found a hedgehog coiled up near the next hedgerow—he was so closely tucked up that we could not tell if he were alive or dead. Hedgehogs have a bad reputation for sucking the milk from reclining cows, but I have never heard of one being caught in the act. We pass the Tithe Farm on our left and keep straight on through a field below Wykin Hall full of mounds and hollows. In the hollows, with patches of <em>juncus</em>, the "Lady Smock" is in full bloom.</p>

<p>After passing across the bridle road that runs from Wykin to the Harrow Farm we go through a wicket gate—one of the very few left in the district. The next fence marks the Hinckley Urban District boundary. Just before we reach this, we pass a spring in the hedge side. Even after the prolonged drought, we could see it bubbling up from the soil. This water has been gathered in the gravel beds forming the Wykin ridge, and on reaching the clays of the valley, comes to the surface. Like the Calybeate springs, once resorted to in Hinckley for their medicinal properties, the water is ironstained. Close by we came across the scene of a tragedy. A dead lamb that had apparently crossed a bit of bog land to reach the water and had died in its struggles to get free.</p>

<p>Why do we turn over our money when we see the first lamb? I don't know, but it is possible that this little superstition came down from the ancients, who may have taken a coin from one pocket or sachet and placed it in another, with a vow to offer it to the shrine of Demeter or Ceres, or whichever goddess presided over the destinies of little lambs.</p>

<p>In the next field we reach the canal bridge; the 20th from the Marston Junction. Those who wish to shorten the walk can return along the towing path either to the Higham Road or to the Coventry Road Wharf. In the warm sunny weather the canal banks are pleasant places. One cannot imagine a more sleepy restful place. The scarce moving water, the slowly moving barges, the drone of a bumble bee that nests in the bank, the patient fisherman leisurely throwing his line; and sometimes, but rarely, the low drooping flight of a heron all contribute to the tranquility of the scene. The splash of a fish, the skim of a may fly, the sudden dart of the dragon fly, or a scurrying water rat fail to counteract its drowsiness. We shall probably be home sooner if we keep to the fields.</p>

<p>A field beyond the canal we cross the "old railway" line. It was once a pleasant walk from Stoke Golding, but it is now so overgrown with gorse bush and bramble that it would make very hard going. What a happy hunting ground it was in my younger days. We used to capture grass snakes there up to four feet long, and exhibit them proudly to the youngsters at home. Near the railway bridge there are features of pond and woodland—haunts of the moor hen and wood pigeon. There is quite a lot of bird life in this secluded spot.</p>

<p>Over the line we cross diagonally a large park-like field and make for a gate high up the field on the right in the direction of Higham Grange Lodge, leaving the woodland known as Higham Thorns to our left. Looking back as we reach the gate a good view is obtained of Hinckley town rising about 100 ft. above the level of where we are now standing. In this field I picked up a block of Shap granite with rocks of Hartshill quartzite indicating the course of a north westerly glacier which swept down from the Lake District and was diverted by the Hartshill range in the direction of the Fen Lanes. It there met the Scandinavian glacier and discharged into what has been hypothetically named Lake Bosworth.</p>

<p>From here the path follows the hedgerows until we come to the road leading into the village of Higham, near the Hall. The change that has come over so many stately homes of England has transformed the Grange into a convalescent home for miners, and the Hall into a school for boys. In the last field but two a pair of plovers wheeled and turned over the stubble trying to lure the intruder from their young. Just off the path I picked up the empty shell of a plover’s egg. Two little brown bits of fluff would be lurking in a hollow not far away.</p>

<p>There is a short ridge road on the left running down to Higham Grange. The view from here must have inspired the poet who wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"From Higham looking down we view,<br>
Stoke in the dale below;<br>
Wykin claims the milking pail,<br>
As plenteous dairies show;<br>
Hinckley distils the malted grain<br>
Whence health and vigour flow."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arrived at the village of Higham one must pay a visit to the church. It has a fine Norman tower with an arcade of semi-circular arches recessed in the second story. Unfortunately the other portions of the church were pulled down and entirely rebuilt in 1790. There was once an alabaster monument in the chancel to a remarkable family named Burton who lived at Lindley Hall. For some unaccountable reason this has disappeared. Ralfe Burton, who died in 1619, had two sons—one William, who wrote the earliest history of Leicestershire, and the other, Robert, was the author of a noted work entitled "The Anatomy of Melancholy."</p>

<p>In the churchyard, leaning against the north wall of the church, is a tombstone to the memory of Edward and Margaret Biddle, who died aged 80, two bachelor sons, John aged 80, and Henry aged 81, one married son, Robert, aged 83, and Sarah, his wife, aged 80. A fine record of longevity.</p>

<p>There is a delightful view from the Churchyard which, unlike so many others, is well tended and kept.</p>

<p>We decided to return to Hinckley by the Watling Street and finish the journey by 'bus from the Long Shoot. This gives us an opportunity of following a footpath running over Harper's Hill, and affords a good view of the Warwickshire country.</p>

<p>The path commences opposite the Church and immediately descends the hill through the middle of a long, narrow field, leaving a line of electric-power poles well to the right. On this side of Higham a small mound is marked on my ordnance map as a "Tumulus (wooden cross and pottery found A.D. 1899)." I am afraid some over-zealous antiquarian badly blundered here. The late Mr. Thos. Marson, of Higham Hall, informed me that his father could remember a windmill standing on the spot. The wooden cross was doubtless the base of an old post mill covered heavily with ballast resembling a mound. My friend, Mr. T. C. Cantrill, of the Geological Survey, has revised the ordnance maps accordingly, but the error is perpetuated in the transactions of the Leicester Archæological Society.</p>

<p>I am informed by an old inhabitant that there was another windmill on the other side of the road.</p>

<p>At the end of the long field the path bears left in the direction of Harper's Hill—a grassy knoll crowned with a clump of trees. We cut off the corners of the two next fields, go through two gates, then by the hedge side to the Hill field. At the second gate we see the incident of a brooklet's source repeated. Like Wykin, Higham is situated on a ridge of gravel underlain on this side by clays and impervious marls. Quite a good stream rises here. At the stile leading to the hill side I met with an unusual experience. On reaching the stile I heard someone, seemingly quite close by, whistling a popular tune. I expected to meet some youths coming along the path over the rise. The whistling continued while I walked some yards, and then stopped, but no one put in an appearance, and although I searched the hedgerows there was no one to be seen. Harper's Hill is a good quarter of a mile from the main road, and I came to the conclusion that there was something in the contour of the country that carried the sound so distinctly from a distance. It left me wondering if the hill had derived its name from this curious phenomenon. I should like to hear if others have had a similar experience. Anyway I'm not going to enlarge on the incident. The "Tumulus" at Higham is enough to inspire caution in any attempt to unravel the mysteries of the past. It is quite possible that a man named John Harper may have owned the hill.</p>

<p>From Harper's Hill one cannot mistake the hedgeside path to the Watling Street, and we reach the main road by a footbridge near to the Hollow Farm.</p>

<p>Two treasures have been found in this neighbourhood—one in 1607 under a large stone in the middle of the Watling Street where it crosses the Higham to Nuneaton road. The hoard comprised 250 silver coins of Henry III., gold rings, parts of a massive gold chain, and a precious stone with Arabic characters. Burton, the historian, went to see them the day after they were found, and suggested that some wandering Jew had hidden them to escape robbery. Did he meet with a worse fate?</p>

<p>The other find was near the old railway bridge on the Harrow Farm. When this line was being constructed in 1871, one of the navvies put his pick through an earthenware jar, and some hundreds of Roman silver coins rolled out into the trench—many of these were sold for a few pence each in the public houses of the town. Eight of them in mint condition are now in my collection. They are of various dates including Trajan, Vespasian, Hadrian, Antoninus, and Faustina Augusta.</p>

<p>A short walk along the main road takes us by the entrance lodge of Higham Grange, and we soon arrive at the site of an old toll gate, at the end of the Long Shoot, where we can board a 'bus.</p>
