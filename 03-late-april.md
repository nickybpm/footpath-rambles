Last week my companion and I chose a walk through the country that lies in the Upper Soar valley, east of Smockington to Sharnford.

Summerlike weather, the brightening colour of the pasture lands and the song of the birds made up for the comparative bareness of the trees and hedgerows. Unfolding leaf buds are just beginning to transform the fretted outlines of the trees into rounded masses of delicate tracery, and the hawthorn hedges are daily becoming more green. With the same hue, the winter-sown corn is toning the warm browns and ochres of the ploughed lands. As we walk the changing landscape holds plenty of charm in colour and form to delight the eye. Within a mile of the main road, within sight of familiar church towers and spires, the field paths give us glimpses of contours and skylines, woodlands and grassy slopes as fresh and unfamiliar as a walk in a distant county.

We took to the fields at Burbage, starting at a Bridle road nearly opposite the Hollies on the Lutterworth Road, and turning by the first gate on the right, proceeded in the direction of Hogue Hall by a path through an allotment. A cheery and industrious gardener beguiled the first stage of our journey. He stoically contemplated a big patch of bare soil which the long spell of frost had denuded of a promising crop from a pound’s worth of onion seed and enthused over the prospects of a vigorous looking plot of spring cabbage. Who wouldn’t own a bit of Britain’s fair and pleasant isle? 2½d. per sq. yard, the price of a small cauliflower, is the present market value of a few acres of rich and fertile soil close to town and main road.

Leaving Burbage Fields farm on our left, the path leads us across three fields of pasture land down a gentle slope to the Soar brook. The point where the Soar actually rises is somewhat in doubt, but the writer has always understood it started at a spring not far from Stretton House and near "Blue Bell Island" on the Wolvey Road. Another spring that flows through Foster's Pond and across the Watling Street joins this above the point we have now reached. As we descend the slope, High Cross, one of three reputed centres of England, can be seen on the sky line.

After crossing the brook and a marshy field, the path runs alongside the right of the next hedgerow and makes for a stile near the farm buildings of Hogue Hall, leaving Hogue Hall spinney two fields away to the left. There's a magpie's nest, with its domed roof, in the hedgerow—an unusually low position. Owing to the magpie's partiality for eggs and young partridges, some farmers put a charge of shot through the nest when the brood appears. The Hall, overshadowed by tall, deciduous trees and a giant Wellingtonia will be noticed in passing. It commands a fine view of rolling pasture lands and used to be a favourite rendezvous for the Atherstone Point-to-Point races.

Just beyond we pick up Sapcote spire to the left, with Burbage Church still in sight in the rear. After crossing a grass field, a gate at the right hand corner leads us along the edge of a field of growing corn to a swiftly flowing stream that joins the Soar brook a quarter of a mile eastwards. Here is a pretty water feature. It is the nearest approach we have to a natural waterfall in the neighbourhood of Hinckley. That it has once been a mill dam need not disillusion you. All trace of the mill has gone. After a period of drought, the amount of water rushing down is surprising. The shining golden celandine bespangles the banks. It is a welcome splash of colour, for with the exception of the drab panicles of dog's mercury, the field daisy and the coltsfoot, it is the only flower yet out. Soon the spot will be aglow with campion, willow herb and stitchwort, and the air laden with the scent of trefoil and meadow sweet. Nearby we found a few artificially-chipped flints in the ploughed fields and a quantity of burnt hearth stones and pot boilers in the banks. They may indicate a camping ground of early inhabitants.

We cross the stream by a footbridge just below the cascade. A stile will be seen to the left in the next hedgerow where we cross another tributary of the Soar and climb diagonally across the next long field of pasture land to the Sharnford and Smockington Road. A few yards down the lane opposite brings us to the little hamlet of Wigston Parva.

Little Wigston, or Wyggeston, as it was once spelt, consists of a small group of houses around a village green. There is an old world look about the place. A brick structure on the green resembling a village well minus its windlass, we were informed, was originally used as a reservoir to feed the cheese presses in the adjoining Manor House. The church is said to be one of the smallest and oldest in the country.

It has been much restored of late, but several early English characteristics have been preserved. The circular arched north doorway with a moulded label or dripstone is possibly transitional Norman.

To reach Sharnford by the fields, we have to retrace our steps to the cascade. The path commences by crossing a field of growing corn and almost until we reach the village of Sharnford, it is difficult to trace. In one place the hedge has been layered across the stile, but if you follow the course of the Soar by keeping it one field away to the left you cannot be far out. It is easy going across pasture land. Where the stiles are missing there are openings in the hedge and there is no necessity to climb fences.

Two fields away from our re-starting point we cross the stream by a well made footbridge with a hand rail. Overhanging trees indicate how little this path is now used. We are now in a small natural valley with a considerable watershed all round. The black peaty nature of the soil thrown up by moles suggests that the river hereabouts once widened out into a sheet of water bordered by rush swamp and bog lands. A search later on in the year should reward the botanist with an interesting flora, for although drainage has produced an ecological change, survivors of a bog land association will doubtless remain. Adder's tongue, several of the orchids and grass of parnassus are found in similar localities.

We reach the main road again at the south west corner of the village of Sharnford. Time does not permit of an exploration. The village takes its name from the ford over the Soar and possibly "Scharn," a Teutonic prefix for dirty. Throsby preserves an old tradition of a boy being skinned alive here. The story goes that a lad tending sheep in a field called the "thorn hills," on the Glebe Farm, overheard a plot by some thieves to rob the house. He told his master and they were thus prevented from carrying out their impious designs. Somehow they fixed on the lad as having given the timely warning and determined to be revenged. They waylaid him one morning, deliberately skinned him alive and wrapped him in a sheepskin.

When last I passed through the village, workmen were demolishing an interesting old half timbered house with herring bone masonry and a date in the early seventeenth century.

The last section of our ramble to Aston Flamville and back to Burbage commences at a stile on the left hand side after passing the last house in the village on the Hinckley road. The path is paved with cobble stones across the first field and crosses the Soar by a brick arch.

The path during this stage is well defined. Mickle Hill soon comes into sight and we keep this two fields away on our left until we come to Aston. Mickle Hill—meaning, of course, little hill—reminds us of that most characteristic Scotch proverb, "many a mickle makes a muckle." We reach Aston by a bridle road leading from Mickle Hill farm and can either return to Burbage by Lychgate Lane, or better still, by a footpath commencing near the Manor House opposite an ancient dovecote or columbary as it was once called. This path comes out on Burbage green near the Hall.

Half way along the Lychgate Lane to Burbage, on the left hand side, there is a disused clay pit and the remains of a brick kiln. Some years ago were found here pieces of broken Roman Mortaria (a vegetable dish) of fine turned earthenware and crude hand-moulded fragments of an early British jar. In this assemblage of culinary utensils one can read how these ancient combatants "buried their hatchets" and eventually dwelt in friendship during the Pax Romana. These relics are still preserved.

> "Rare are the buttons of a Roman's breeches,<br>
> In antiquarian eyes surpassing riches;<br>
> Rare is each crack'd black rotten earthen dish,<br>
> That held of ancient Rome the flesh and fish."<br>
> Peter Pindar.

We must ramble again to Aston Flamville some other time when we can find time to explore it. It has many historical associations and is more than usually picturesque.
